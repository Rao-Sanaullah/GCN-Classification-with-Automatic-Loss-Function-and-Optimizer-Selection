# Streamlined Training of GCN for Node Classification with Automatic Loss Function and Optimizer Selection


Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are specialized types of neural networks that process and learn from graph-structured data. For GNNs to perform optimally, it is crucial to automatically select the best loss and optimization functions. Doing so can save time and eliminate the need for domain-specific knowledge. Automatic selection of these functions is essential for GNNs to achieve state-of-the-art results. In this research, we trained Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) and Graph Attention Networks (GAT) models to classify nodes on three benchmark datasets. To select the best loss and optimization functions, we employed performance metrics and implemented a learning rate scheduler to enhance the model's performance. We assessed the model's performance using multiple metrics and reported the best loss function and performance metric. Our approach delivered state-of-the-art results and showcased the significance of selecting the appropriate loss and optimizer functions. Additionally, we developed a real-time visualization of the GCN model during training that provided users with an in-depth comprehension of the model's behavior. This study provides a comprehensive understanding of GNNs and their application to graph-structured data, focusing on real-time visualization of GNN behavior during training.
